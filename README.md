Android App - PLANETS APP

Developed an Android application using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio that showcases the solar system's planets and their number of moons in a listView. 
The app features a visually appealing UI built with Material Design principles, displaying the names and images of all planets. 
Users can click on each planet to view detailed information, including the number of moons associated with that planet. 
Implemented RecyclerView for efficient display and scrolling of planetary data, while utilizing Intents to manage navigation between the main view and detail views.
